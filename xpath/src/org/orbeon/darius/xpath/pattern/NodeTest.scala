/**
 * A NodeTest is a simple kind of pattern that enables a context-free test of whether
 * a node has a particular
 * name. There are several kinds of node test: a full name test, a prefix test, and an
 * "any node of a given type" test, an "any node of any type" test, a "no nodes"
 * test (used, e.g. for "@comment()").
 *
 * <p>As well as being used to support XSLT pattern matching, NodeTests act as predicates in
 * axis steps, and also act as item types for type matching.</p>
 *
 * <p>For use in user-written application calling [[NodeInfo.iterateAxis(byte, NodeTest)]],
 * it is possible to write a user-defined subclass of <code>NodeTest</code> that implements
 * a single method, [[matches(int, client.net.sf.saxon.ce.om.StructuredQName)]]</p>
