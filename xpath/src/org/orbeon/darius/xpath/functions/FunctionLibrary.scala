 * functions, Java extension functions, stylesheet functions, and so on. There is also an implementation
 * [[org.orbeon.darius.xpath.functions.FunctionLibraryList]] that allows a FunctionLibrary
 * to be constructed by combining other FunctionLibrary objects.

   * Bind a function, given the URI and local parts of the function name,

   * time.
   * @param functionName the QName of the function being called
   * @param staticArgs  The expressions supplied statically in arguments to the function call.
   * The length of this array represents the arity of the function. The intention is
   * that the static type of the arguments (obtainable via getItemType() and getCardinality()) may
   * be used as part of the binding algorithm. In some cases it may be possible for the function
   * to be pre-evaluated at compile time, for example if these expressions are all constant values.
   * <p>
   * The conventions of the XPath language demand that the results of a function depend only on the
   * values of the expressions supplied as arguments, and not on the form of those expressions. For
   * example, the result of f(4) is expected to be the same as f(2+2). The actual expression is supplied
   * here to enable the binding mechanism to select the most efficient possible implementation (including
   * compile-time pre-evaluation where appropriate).
   * @param env The static context of the function call
   * @param container The container for the newly created Expression
   * @return An expression equivalent to a call on the specified function, if one is found;
   * null if no function was found matching the required name and arity.
   * @throws org.orbeon.darius.xpath.trans.XPathException if a function is found with the required name and arity, but
   * the implementation of the function cannot be loaded or used; or if an error occurs
   * while searching for the function.
