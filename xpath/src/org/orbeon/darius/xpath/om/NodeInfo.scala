/**
 * The NodeInfo interface represents a node in Saxon's implementation of the XPath 2.0 data model.
 * <p>
 * Note that several NodeInfo objects may represent the same node. To test node identity, the
 * method [[isSameNodeInfo(NodeInfo)]] should be used. An exception to this rule applies for
 * document nodes, where the correspondence between document nodes and DocumentInfo objects is one to
 * one. NodeInfo objects are never reused: a given NodeInfo object represents the same node for its entire
 * lifetime.
 * <p>
 * This is the primary interface for accessing trees in Saxon, and it forms part of the public
 * Saxon API. The only subclass of NodeInfo that applications should normally use is [[DocumentInfo]],
 * which represents a document node. Methods that form part of the public API are (since Saxon 8.4)
 * labelled with a JavaDoc "since" tag: classes and methods that have no such label should not be
 * regarded as stable interfaces.
 * <p>
 * The interface represented by this class is at a slightly higher level than the abstraction described
 * in the W3C data model specification, in that it includes support for the XPath axes, rather than exposing
 * the lower-level properties (such as "parent" and "children") directly. All navigation within trees,
 * except for a few convenience methods, is done by following the axes using the iterateAxis method.
 * This allows different implementations of the XPath tree model to implement axis navigation in different ways.
 * Some implementations may choose to use the helper methods provided in class [[org.orbeon.darius.xpath.tree.util.Navigator]].
 * <p>
 * Note that the stability of this interface applies to classes that use the interface,
 * not to classes that implement it. The interface may be extended in future to add new methods.
 * <p>
 * New implementations of NodeInfo are advised also to implement the methods in interface
 * ExtendedNodeInfo, which will be moved into this interface at some time in the future.
 *
 * @author Michael H. Kay
 * @since 8.4. Extended with three extra methods, previously in ExtendedNodeInfo, in 9.1
