/**
 * A SequenceIterator is used to iterate over any XPath 2 sequence (of values or nodes).
 * To get the next item in a sequence, call next(); if this returns null, you've
 * reached the end of the sequence.
 * <p>
 * A SequenceIterator keeps track of the current Item and the current position.
 * The objects returned by the SequenceIterator will always be either nodes
 * (class NodeInfo) or singleton values (class AtomicValue): these are represented
 * collectively by the interface Item.
 * <p>
 * This interface forms part of the public Saxon API. The JavaDoc "since" flag is used from
 * release 8.4 onwards to indicate methods that are considered to be a stable part
 * of the API. Methods without a "since" flag should not be regarded as a stable part
 * of the API.
 * <p>
 * Note that the stability of this interface applies to classes that use the interface,
 * not to classes that implement it. The interface may be extended in future to add new methods.
