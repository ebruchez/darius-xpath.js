/**
 * This interface represents a document node as defined in the XPath 2.0 data model.
 * It extends NodeInfo, which is used to represent any node. Every document node must
 * be an instance of DocumentInfo.
 * <p>
 * The interface supports two methods in addition to those for NodeInfo: one to find
 * elements given their ID value, and one to locate unparsed entities. In addition,
 * document nodes have an important property that is not true of nodes in general:
 * two distinct Java DocumentInfo objects never represent the same document node.
 * So the Java "==" operator returns the same result as the [[NodeInfo.isSameNodeInfo]]
 * method.
 * <p>
 * This interface is part of the Saxon public API, and as such (from Saxon8.4 onwards)
 * those methods that form part of the stable public API are labelled with a JavaDoc "since" tag
 * to indicate when they were added to the product.
 *
 * @author Michael H. Kay
